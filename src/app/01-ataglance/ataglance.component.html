<h1>AT A GLANCE</h1>

<section>
    <p>
    Welcome to my dynamic resume ! This website is my playground. It is my starting point when it comes to trying new development tools. Since it's mostly backed by my resume's data, it is also a good way for me to introduce myself and give some insight into my work experience and skills.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the moment you can find a set of components below that will let you dig through all my resume data. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I promise I'll try to keep things as clean as possible. Please leave me a note in case you see something weird. (Valid also for my english since I'm not an English native speaker). 
    </p>
    <p>
    In case you don't know me yet I've put together a <b>list of values</b> that I believe define me best.

<div class="detail-box-line">
    <app-detailbox logo="icon-heart" title="passion driven">Quality takes time and effort. There's no such thing if you lack passion in what you do. I love my job and feel very fortunate that my passion can pay my bills.</app-detailbox>
    <app-detailbox logo="icon-settings" title="hard working" >In today's constant changing environments with such a variety of platforms and technologies there's no other way to make a difference. But again, when you love what you do, <span style="white-space: nowrap">is it still work ?</span></app-detailbox>
    <app-detailbox logo="icon-clock" title="delivery focused">
Because of increasingly competitive markets, time to market has become a major factor of success. I strongly believe in Lean Product Development and MVP approach.

<div class="detail-box-line">
    <app-detailbox logo="icon-email-luminosity" title="persistent">
As someone said 'Failure cannot cope with persistence'. I made this my motto as I think there's always a solution to a problem. Success is just a matter of not giving up too early.        
    </app-detailbox>
    <app-detailbox logo="icon-user-add" title="team player">
Success is a team thing. You will never accomplish great things without the help of others. Therefore I value  communication and interpersonal skills above everything else.        
    </app-detailbox>

<div class="detail-box-line">
    <app-detailbox logo="icon-world" title="curious by nature" >
        Learn or retire. I choose not to retire yet. Since I started working in the development business, I never stopped learning and this is part of what keeps me moving forward still today.
