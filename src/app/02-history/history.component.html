<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<section>
<p>Through the years I have worked on multiple projects and experienced a wide range of technologies. While a new language or a new framework can seem exciting at first it often takes a lot of work to become proficient. But then as time goes by, you realise that the same concepts get recycled every now and then and this is where experience comes into play. I believe that for the most part, experience is about recognizing patterns and concepts and finding the answer to questions by adapting knowledge to a new situation.</p>
<p>Talking about experience, let's have a look at the following component. This is a list containing most of the projects I've been involved in. The table is sorted in reverse order and a features a timeline to situate selected project in time. I developed this component using <b>Angular2, HTML5, Sass, RxJs</b> ... and many others. Don't hesitate to leave me a message in case you need some more detail.</p>

<p>As you can see the information here is quite dense. I'm not quite happy yet with the presentation but this will do for the time being. I will probably make this part evolve as new ideas arise. Again, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestion !</p>
